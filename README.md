Let's learn how GitHub works!

Hello, my name is Dennis. I am making a GitHub to store my Jupyter Workbooks, but I also hope to write a Python application or two in the future.
I've gotten into Star Wars recently, and I used to play a lot of Halo 5. I also like to take photos and I yoyo sometimes, but I don't combine the two.
